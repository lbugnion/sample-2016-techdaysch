# Abstract

With the release of Windows 10 and the so-called Universal Windows Platform UWP, Microsoft is pushing forward with the strategy of developing your applications once and running them on multiple platforms. With one code base and a few adaptations in the user interface, you can get the same binary on devices as diverse as Internet-of-Things (IOT), Phones, Tablets, Desktop PCs, Surface Hubs, XBOX and even a holographic computer. In this talk, Laurent Bugnion, a pioneer of cross platform development using XAML and C# since 2006, will show you how to use your skills to create universal apps. We will recap what a UWP is, how it is developed, polished, deployed and published to the one and only Windows Store. We will also talk about the iOS Bridge (project Islandwood) allowing an iOS developer to port his app to Windows 10, and we will finish with a demo of the Windows Continuum which transforms a Windows 10 mobile device into a lightweight but powerful desktop computer.
